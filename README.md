# Ethical Honeypot Website (Example)

This project demonstrates the concept of a honeypot website used for educational purposes only. The primary goal of this project is to raise awareness about cybersecurity and the importance of protecting personal information online. Please note that any unethical or illegal use of this technology is strongly discouraged and against the law.

## What is a Honeypot Website?

A honeypot website is a simulated online resource designed to attract potential attackers or cybercriminals. It acts as a decoy to gather information about their tactics and techniques. Ethical hackers and security professionals use honeypots to:

- Study and analyze attack patterns
- Enhance cybersecurity awareness
- Develop effective security measures
- Protect real systems and data

## Purpose of This Demo

This demo project aims to illustrate the vulnerability of unsecured online platforms and the ease with which attackers can harvest information from unsuspecting users. However, it is essential to emphasize that our intentions are purely educational, and we do not condone any malicious or illegal activities.
